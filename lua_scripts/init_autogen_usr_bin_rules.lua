-- This script is executed by sb2d, while initializing a new session,
-- to create mapping rules for toolchain components:
-- For example, /usr/bin/gcc will be mapped to the toolchain. These rules
-- are used for other filesystem operations than exec*
-- (for example, when the shell is looking for a program, it must be
-- possible to stat() the destination)
--
-- This file is based on "create_argvmods_usr_bin_rules.lua", which
-- did the same thing (but was executed to process just one mapping mode,
-- from the "sb2" script during session setup)
